# Core-Mechanics-Prototype
Prototype for Studio 2 subject - Will be rewritten later


Core Mechanic is a game with a simple puzzle concent.
It's a platformer in which you have a ball capable of several powers, depending on its composition. These powers so far are:
	- Metal ball: Magnetic and allows you to teleport to the ball
	- Heat ball: Radiates heat and can cause an explosion
	- Ice ball: Freezes surfaces and can cause an ice nova
	- Gravity ball: Weightless and can be used to pause time in a radius
	- Plasma ball: Transient, produces light, and can be used to fuse circuitry
	
The powers may change as we develop the game further.

This repo is for my own testing and programming. I'll be using it to make a functional prototype with no care for the structure and neatness of the code.
Later on I'll rewrite everything with what I've learned. We only have a few weeks to work on this so I'll have to work fast!

Let's hope it goes well!
